# Employee Complaint Portal
Welcome to the Employee Complaint Portal project! This desktop application is built using Java in NetBeans IDE and connected with a Microsoft Access database. The portal serves as a platform for employees to submit complaints, and it functions as both an admin and employee interface.

## Features
**Complaint Submission:** Employees can submit complaints through the portal, providing details such as the nature of the complaint, date, and department.
**Admin Dashboard:** Admins have access to a dashboard where they can view, manage, and respond to employee complaints.
**Employee Interface:** Employees can track the status of their complaints and view any responses or updates provided by the admin.
**MS Access Database:** The project utilizes a Microsoft Access database to store and retrieve complaint data, ensuring data integrity and efficiency.
**Object-Oriented Design:** The application is designed using object-oriented principles, ensuring modularity, reusability, and maintainability of code.

## Installation
**To run the application locally, follow these steps:**

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open the project in NetBeans IDE.
Ensure you have Microsoft Access installed on your local machine or a compatible environment.
Import the provided MS Access database file (.accdb) to set up the database structure.
Update the database connection details in the project code to point to your MS Access database.

## Technologies Used
**Java:** The programming language used for the application logic and user interface.
**NetBeans IDE:** The Integrated Development Environment used for Java development.
**Microsoft Access:** The relational database management system used for storing and retrieving complaint data.
**MS Access JDBC Driver:** The Java Database Connectivity driver used to connect Java applications with MS Access databases.

##Object-Oriented Design
The project adheres to the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), including:

**Encapsulation:** Data and behavior are encapsulated within objects, promoting data security and code organization.
**Inheritance:** The project utilizes inheritance to establish relationships between classes, facilitating code reuse and extension.
**Polymorphism:** Polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and interface implementation, allowing for flexibility and modularity in code design.
